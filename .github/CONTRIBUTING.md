### I want to fix a bug.

If you want to work on a bug to fix it, please follow these steps:

1. If the bug hasn't been reported [here](https://github.com/Mammad900/GUI-For-Arduino-TFT/issues), please report it using the steps described earlier. Please tell me if you want to work on it yourself
2. Fork this repository using the icon at the top right of the page
3. Edit the source code in the fork to fix the issue.  
   To make it easier to edit the code, use an editor which offers code-folding with indentation (like [Arduino Pro IDE](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-pro-ide)) and fold all the code to find the code you are looking for easier.
4. Create a pull request using [this](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) guide.
